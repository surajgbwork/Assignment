The key hyperparameters in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm play a crucial role in determining its performance. The most important hyperparameter is the number of neighbors (k), which specifies how many nearby data points are considered when making predictions. A smaller value of k makes the model sensitive to noise, leading to overfitting, while a larger k smooths the decision boundary but may cause underfitting. Another important parameter is the distance metric, which defines how similarity between data points is measured. Common choices include Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Cosine, and Hamming distances. The weights parameter determines how much influence each neighbor has on the prediction — it can either assign equal weight to all neighbors (uniform) or give more weight to closer points (distance-based). The algorithm parameter specifies the method used to compute nearest neighbors, such as brute, kd_tree, ball_tree, or auto, each offering different computational efficiencies. Finally, leaf size affects the speed and memory usage when tree-based algorithms are used.
KNN supports various distance metrics for measuring similarity between data points. The most commonly used is the Euclidean distance, which calculates the straight-line distance between points and is ideal for continuous numerical data. The Manhattan distance measures the sum of absolute differences, suitable for grid-like data. The Minkowski distance is a generalized form of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances, depending on the value of p. For text or high-dimensional data, Cosine similarity is often used to measure the angle between two vectors, while the Hamming distance is applied to categorical or binary variables by counting the number of differing attributes. The choice of hyperparameters and distance metric directly impacts KNN’s accuracy, sensitivity to noise, and computational efficiency.
