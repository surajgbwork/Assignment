Lift is a metric used in association rule mining to evaluate how much more likely two items occur together compared to if they were independent. Mathematically, it is the ratio of the observed support of X→Y to the expected support if X and Y were independent:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Lift(X→Y)=Support(X)×Support(Y)Support(X∪Y)                                                                            A lift value greater than 1 indicates a positive association (items co-occur more often than expected), a value equal to 1 means no association (independence), and a value less than 1 suggests a negative association. Lift is important because it helps identify truly meaningful rules by filtering out rules that occur just due to high individual item frequency but lack real correlation.
Support measures how frequently an itemset appears in the dataset. For example, the support of X is the proportion of transactions that contain x.                           Support(X)=Number of transactions containing X/Total transactions                                                                                       Confidence measures the strength of an association rule X→Y.t is the probability of finding Confidence(X→Y)=Support(X∪Y)/Support(X)
While association rules are powerful for discovering hidden patterns in data, they also come with limitations. One major challenge is the generation of a large number of rules, many of which may be redundant or not practically useful. Another issue is the support-confidence framework, which may miss interesting rules if they occur infrequently but are still valuable. Association rule mining can also struggle with scalability, as processing very large datasets with many features becomes computationally expensive. Additionally, the rules often lack contextual or causal meaning, meaning high lift or confidence does not necessarily imply real-world significance. Proper domain knowledge and rule pruning techniques are often required to overcome these challenges.
