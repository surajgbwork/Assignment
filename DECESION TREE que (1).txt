Decision tree models have several important hyperparameters that control their complexity and performance. One of the most influential is max_depth, which determines how deep the tree can grow. A shallow tree with a small depth may underfit the data by being too simple, while a very deep tree can capture too much detail and overfit the training set. Similarly, min_samples_split specifies the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. If this number is large, the tree will create fewer splits, leading to a simpler model, while smaller values allow more splits and increase model complexity. Another key parameter is min_samples_leaf, which enforces a minimum number of samples at each leaf node. Larger values smooth the decision boundaries and reduce overfitting, whereas smaller values produce a more detailed tree structure.
 max_features parameter controls how many features are considered when choosing the best split. By restricting this number, the model reduces variance and becomes less prone to overfitting, but it might increase bias. Additionally, the criterion parameter defines how the quality of a split is measured. For classification tasks, common choices are Gini impurity and entropy, while regression tasks use measures such as squared error or absolute error. Other hyperparameters like max_leaf_nodes and min_impurity_decrease also help in pruning unnecessary splits, which prevents overfitting. Overall, tuning these hyperparameters allows you to balance the trade-off between bias and variance in decision trees.
When working with categorical data, encoding is necessary to convert categories into numerical form that machine learning algorithms can process. Label encoding assigns each unique category a numeric value, for example mapping “Red,” “Blue,” and “Green” to 0, 1, and 2 respectively. While this method is simple and efficient, it introduces an artificial sense of order between categories (implying, for instance, that Green > Blue > Red), which may confuse models that interpret numerical relationships literally. However, tree-based models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting do not rely on numeric ordering in the same way, so label encoding is generally safe to use with them.
In contrast, one-hot encoding creates a new binary column for each category, where a category is represented by a “1” in its corresponding column and “0” in all others. Using the same example, “Red” would become [1,0,0], “Blue” [0,1,0], and “Green” [0,0,1]. This method avoids the problem of imposing a false ordinal relationship, making it more suitable for most machine learning algorithms. The trade-off is that one-hot encoding increases the dimensionality of the dataset, which can become problematic when there are many categories with sparse values. In summary, label encoding is compact but risks misleading certain models, while one-hot encoding is more robust and widely applicable, though at the cost of higher dimensionality.
