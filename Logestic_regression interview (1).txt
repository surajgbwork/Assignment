Precision and recall are evaluation metrics used in classification problems, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive, reflecting how accurate the model’s positive predictions are. In contrast, Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances, reflecting the model’s ability to identify positive cases. In simple terms, precision answers “Of all the items I labeled as positive, how many are truly positive?” while recall answers “Of all the truly positive items, how many did I correctly identify?”. The balance between precision and recall is often managed using the F1-score.
Cross-validation is a model validation technique used to assess how well a machine learning model generalizes to unseen data. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on some folds, and testing it on the remaining fold, then repeating the process several times. The most common approach is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k subsets, and each subset gets a turn as the test set. This process reduces the risk of overfitting, ensures that the model’s performance is not dependent on one particular train-test split, and provides a more reliable estimate of accuracy, precision, recall, or other metrics. In binary classification, cross-validation is particularly important when the dataset is small or imbalanced, as it helps in ensuring fair evaluation and model stability.
